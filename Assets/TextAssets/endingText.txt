Hey, you did it! Hope you enjoyed playing my little minigame!

I'd love the opportunity to work with you guys on Tofugu's various projects.

I'm a generalist developer and always pick up new stuff really quickly, so I'd gladly help out wherever needed: developing your learning apps (WaniKani, EtoEto), maintaining your site, back-end work...
Anything, really!

Being a student, I have much to learn from you guys, not just from your engineering team but also in the art department and on the business side as well.

Japanese is also a passion of mine; I studied it for 5+ years with every resource known to man. Speaking is my weakest point, which is where the voice recognition idea came from.

The only downside is I can't relocate to Oregon, since I live in Canada and my situation doesn't allow for moving at the moment.

So yeah, hopefully I managed to spark some interest!
I had a lot of fun on this project and hope you enjoyed it!

My contact info is in the email I sent you with my application.
And if you don't wanna hire me... keep the game, I guess? It's a gift! ;) Thanks for taking the time to review my application! Have a nice day!   -Remy
