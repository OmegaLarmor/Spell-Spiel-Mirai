Hi Tofugu team!
I'm happy to present to you my project/application to your internship.
It's a demo for a Japanese learning game!

This is a spin on a previous game I created within Gamkedo club, an online game development community.
The original, called Spell Spiel, was a touch-typing game; now it's a Japanese speaking game!

The gameplay is simple: every turn, you are shown a word in Japanese. Simply press and hold Ctrl to start recording your voice, and release to stop your spell cast.
If pronounced correctly, you'll land a sweet magic spell!

I made almost all of this game myself, along with some assets from Gamkedo members and the voice recognition being a Unity purchased asset.

You can beat it pretty quickly (5 min), and the gameplay isn't fully fleshed out: the objective is getting the player to repeat a few simple words in Japanese.
It's meant as a teaser of what a Japanese learning RPG could look like.

The first enemy is a dummy so you can get warmed up. Good luck, hope you enjoy it!
